Add places, floors, geofences, etc</h3> <p>In case you only want to use native location services (GPS, cellular, WiFi), you can start by adding at least one geofence and optionally one action flow. After that you can install our iOS or Android Management App and try things out. To get better analytics, you can also add a place, floors and departments. </p> <p>Please note that native location services are mostly good for outdoor purposes which doesn’t require a place, floors or departments.</p> <p>For indoor geofencing, we highly recommend you to add some BLE beacons (Eddystone & iBeacon specifications supported) and/or IndoorAtlas. Adding BLE beacons and/or using IndoorAtlas requires that you also setup a place, at least one floor and one department.</p> <p>In case you have difficulties doing the required tasks, please contact our support using the online chat at the bottom right corner or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@proximi.io">support@proximi.io</a>.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/step1.0b656699.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="margin: 15px auto"> </div> </div> </uib-tab> <uib-tab index="1"> <uib-tab-heading> <div style="min-width: 150px"> Import BLE beacons, setup IndoorAtlas <span class="badge badge-default pull-right wizard-step">2</span> </div> </uib-tab-heading> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <h3>Step 2. Adding BLE beacons, setting up the IndoorAtlas</h3> <p>Native location services are mostly good for outdoor purposes, so in case you’re planning to do indoor positioning & geofencing, it’s highly recommended that you also add some BLE beacons within the venue in hand.</p> <p>You can also map the venue by using IndoorAtlas geomagnetic indoor positioning technology. With our platform it’s really simple to combine BLE beacons with IndoorAtlas for automated floor changes etc. After you’ve mapped the venue, add the required IndoorAtlas API key’s under places section, enable IndoorAtlas under app settings and you’re good to go.</p> <p>We support Eddystone & iBeacon specifications for BLE beacons. At the moment we have import tools for Kontakt.io, Estimote and Sensoro. More import options will be added in the future.</p> <p>We calculate the position estimate when a given space has more than one BLE beacon available.</p> <p>In case you have difficulties doing the required tasks, please contact our support using the online chat at the bottom right corner or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@proximi.io">support@proximi.io</a>.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/step2.0369176e.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="margin: 15px auto"> </div> </div> </uib-tab> <uib-tab index="2"> <uib-tab-heading> Setup action flows <span class="badge badge-default pull-right wizard-step">3</span> </uib-tab-heading> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <h3>Step 3. Setup action flows</h3> <p>After you’ve defined the prerequisites, the final step before trying things out is to define some action flows. Action flows are not required to gather analytics but are mandatory for doing any kind of external or mobile interactions.</p> <p>Most of the times you want to start your action flows with Proximi.io Event Receiver which is triggered when a visitor enters or exits any of the defined geofences.</p> <p>After the Proximi.io Event Receiver you can for add a switch node to segment the interaction; for example, check the department with data.department propery, You can see all the available properties and resources from our REST API documentation: <a href="https://proximi.io/docs/rest-api" target="_blank">https://proximi.io/docs/rest-api</a>. You can also use the Resource node for accessing data.</p> <p>In case you want to deliver a payload to the mobile device, you can close the action flow with Proximi.io Event Transmitter.</p> <p>In case you have difficulties doing the required tasks, please contact our support using the online chat at the bottom right corner or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@proximi.io">support@proximi.io</a>.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/step3.48d7ad7a.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="margin: 15px auto"> </div> </div> </uib-tab> <uib-tab index="3"> <uib-tab-heading> <div style="min-width: 150px"> Try things out with our management app! <span class="badge badge-default pull-right wizard-step">4</span> </div> </uib-tab-heading> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <h3>Step 4.
